Displaying Images in HTML
 7 min read |  October 30, 2017 | by Yaakov Chaikin
This article is part of the Beginner Web Developer Series. The series is targeted to people who‚Äôd like to start serious web development, as well as people who are already web developers and want to solidify their knowledge of fundamentals while possibly filling in some holes. If you find yourself tinkering with HTML, CSS, or Javascript until you sort of get it to work, this series is for you. The material in this series is closely tied to my top-rated Coursera course.
Perhaps nothing enhances a website better than strategically placed images.
If you‚Äôve been following my previous posts in this series, this one should feel super easy. However, there are some small gotchas when it comes to images in HTML.
Read on.
To start, let‚Äôs jump straight into an example.
You may recognize the code from the article on HTML Character Entity References. The content is one of my favorite quotes from Theodore Roosevelt. However, this time, I‚Äôll also include an picture (i.e., an image) of Theodore Roosevelt right before the quote.First, notice that some of the HTML code is commented out. I explained what this means and how it affects what the browser loads in the article on Creating Internal and External HTML Links. (Reminder: the browser doesn‚Äôt render the commented out part.)
Lines 12 through 15 show an <img> tag, which stands for‚Ä¶ an image (how did you guess? üòÄ)
The src attribute (which stands for source) is no different than the href attribute that you‚Äôve seen when I discussed how to create links in HTML. The value of the src attribute should be a URL that points to some image file.
The value of the src attribute is expressed as a relative path (i.e., not http://‚Ä¶ present). The value picture-with-quote.jpg means that the browser will look for the file named picture-with-quote.jpg in the same directory the images.html file is located. In other words, this is an internal link to an image file.
The alt attribute value should contain text that can be read by screen readers to describe to visually impaired people what is pictured in the image.
There are 2 more attributes (width and height). We‚Äôll discuss those in a minute.
Let‚Äôs take a look at this HTML page in the browser:
Browser screenshot of the quote with an inline image
As you can see, the image appears inline as if it‚Äôs just another text character in the sentence.
That should tell us right away that an <img> tag is an inline element. If it weren‚Äôt, the image would be on its own line, pushing everything following the <img> tag onto a new line.
Link To External Image
The images you display on your page can also be hosted externally to your site.
Let‚Äôs uncomment (i.e., remove the comment tags) around the <img> tag at the end of our HTML code and reload the page in the browser:
Browser screenshot of the quote with an inline image with external image
Easy enough, right?! üëç width and height Image Attributes
While not absolutely required, it‚Äôs a really good idea to always specify the width and the height of the image.
It‚Äôs very often the case that you use images as visual anchors in the layout of your page. In other words, the layout of your page relies on the image being a certain size.
For example, your design may dictate that the top 200 pixels are taken up by some header image, followed by some text below the image.
As I discussed previously, browsers read and interpret HTML sequentially, starting at the top of the HTML document.
The browser will read the header image tag and start loading the image, pointed to by the src attribute. However, the browser does not wait for the image to load before it continues to read and render the rest of the HTML code. The image loading happens in parallel as the browser proceeds to interpret and render the rest of the HTML onto the screen.
Usually, images take longer to download than the text-based HTML code. Therefore, the browser will be ready to display the text that was supposed to follow the header image before the header image is downloaded and displayed.
However, without the fully downloaded image file, there is no way to find out its size, i.e., the width and height. The browser will not allocate any space for the image.
To the user, the visual affect will be that the text, which was supposed to appear below the image, will appear at the top at first, then jump down as the image is shown.
To solve this problem, HTML allows us to inform the browser upfront about the image size, even before it‚Äôs downloaded, by specifying the width and height attributes on the <img> tag.
If we don‚Äôt specify the width and height of the image, the browser will still figure out the size, but after it downloads the image, potentially causing layout jumpiness.
If the image file is small in size and the user has a really fast Internet connection, this may just appear as a momentary flicker. With larger image sizes and a slower Internet connection, this will translate into a bit more of jarring experience.
Simulating Slower Internet Connection For Testing in Chrome
It‚Äôs always good to test what your site looks like as it loads on a slower Internet connection. That type of testing gives you a great front row seat to the experience that a user of your site might end up having.
You can simulate such an experience with Chrome Developer Tools (CDT) without any additional plugins. The Chrome browser comes with Chrome Developer tools, which include connection throttling as one of the options.
Open up CDT by using a keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Alt-I (on Windows) or Option-Command-I (on a Mac) and click on the Network tab. Then, click the arrow next to the word Online and choose a slower connection you want to test. (You can also configure a custom connection speed by choosing Custom.)
